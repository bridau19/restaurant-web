      <div class="font">
        <p> Growing up in a California, I always felt like a typical American girl, except for when my mother would cook breakfast. She always cooked traditional American breakfast foods, but added in dishes and techniques she remembered from growing up in Korea and later living in a Korean household in America.</p>
        <p> Eating mom's food made me feel both connected to my heritage and proud to be American at the same time. She showed me that being American does not mean forgetting where you came from, but embracing the many cultures and traditions that live in a nation of immigrants. . .
